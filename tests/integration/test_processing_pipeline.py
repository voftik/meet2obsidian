# EPIC 27 Implementation Summary
"""
Implementation of EPIC 27: Integration of File Processing Components

The implementation of EPIC 27 successfully integrates the following components:
1. FileWatcher - Monitors directories for new files
2. ProcessingQueue - Manages the queue of files to be processed
3. AudioExtractor - Extracts audio from video files
4. CacheManager - Caches results to avoid redundant processing

Key features implemented:
1. ProcessingPipeline class (/meet2obsidian/processing/pipeline.py):
   - Central class that coordinates all components
   - Connects FileWatcher with ProcessingQueue
   - Integrates AudioExtractor with the processing chain
   - Uses CacheManager to store and retrieve cached results
   - Provides centralized logging for all components

2. Enhanced logging system:
   - Added setup_component_logging function for consistent logging
   - Implemented contextual logging with component identification
   - Created centralized log file configuration

3. Integration into ApplicationManager:
   - Updated ApplicationManager to use the ProcessingPipeline
   - Added proper startup and shutdown handling
   - Enhanced status reporting to include pipeline information
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing components

4. Integration tests:
   - Created comprehensive test suite for the ProcessingPipeline
   - Tests for basic integration of components
   - Tests for cache handling and invalidation
   - Tests for error handling and recovery

This implementation creates a cohesive processing system that:
- Automatically detects new video files
- Extracts audio from videos using configurated settings
- Caches results to avoid redundant processing
- Provides detailed status information
- Handles errors gracefully with retry capabilities
- Logs operations in a structured, contextual format

The implementation is designed to be:
- Thread-safe for concurrent processing
- Configurable through configuration manager
- Robust with proper error handling
- Scalable with multiple concurrent processing tasks
- Maintainable with clear component boundaries and interfaces
