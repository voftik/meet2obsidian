## üìù Description

Meet2Obsidian automatically processes meeting recordings, converts them to text, and creates structured notes in your Obsidian vault. Using AI, it analyzes meeting content to extract key information: main topics, agreements reached, and action items - helping you maintain a comprehensive, searchable archive of your meetings.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Automated Recording Processing**: Monitors for new MP4 files in your designated meetings directory
- **Audio Extraction**: Converts videos to audio format (M4A) while preserving original filenames
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Transcribes speech using Rev.ai's powerful API
- **Structured Notes**: Automatically creates Obsidian notes with sections for:
  - Meeting Information
  - Executive Summary
  - Agreements & Decisions
  - Action Items & Tasks
  - Complete Transcript
- **AI-Powered Content Analysis**: Leverages Claude API to analyze transcripts and extract valuable insights
- **File Management**: Automatically cleans up processed files from your meetings directory
- **Customizable Prompts**: Configure how AI analyzes your meetings with editable prompt templates
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely using macOS Keychain

## üîß How It Works

1. The utility monitors changes in your `/Documents/meet_records/` directory (or custom path)
2. When a new MP4 file is detected:
   - Audio is extracted and saved as an M4A file
   - Original MP4 file is removed to save space
3. Audio file is sent to Rev.ai service for transcription
4. Upon receiving the transcription:
   - Creates "Meeting Records" directory in your Obsidian vault (if not exists)
   - Creates a new note with a name matching the original file
   - Adds the transcription to the "Transcript" section
5. Using Claude API, the tool analyzes the transcript and:
   - Extracts key meeting information
   - Creates an executive summary
   - Identifies agreements and decisions
   - Compiles a list of action items and assigned tasks
6. All processed files are removed from the source directory
7. Optionally links to relevant notes in your vault based on content analysis

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS system (currently only macOS is supported)
- Python 3.9 or higher
- FFmpeg (installed via Homebrew)
- Obsidian installed on your computer
- Rev.ai account for transcription services
- Anthropic Claude API key for content analysis

### Installation

#### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/voftik/meet2obsidian.git
cd meet2obsidian

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

#### User Installation (Once Released)

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install voftik/tools/meet2obsidian

# Or install via pip
pip install meet2obsidian
```

### Initial Setup

On first launch, Meet2Obsidian will ask for and securely store:
- Path to your Obsidian vault
- Rev.ai API key
- Anthropic Claude API key
- Preferred configuration options

These settings are stored securely in macOS Keychain.

### Usage

```bash
# Start the service
meet2obsidian start

# Check status
meet2obsidian status

# Stop the service
meet2obsidian stop

# Configure settings
meet2obsidian config
```

## üîê Security and Privacy

- API keys are stored securely using macOS Keychain
- All processing happens locally on your machine except for API calls
- No meeting content is stored on external servers beyond necessary API processing
- Temporary files are securely managed and cleaned up after processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

Meet2Obsidian offers several customization options:

- **Custom Prompts**: Edit AI analysis prompts for different meeting types
- **Templating**: Customize Obsidian note templates
- **Scheduling**: Set up automatic processing at specific times
- **Caching**: Efficient caching system for optimizing API usage and improving performance

## üìã Future Roadmap

- [ ] Support for additional video/audio formats
- [ ] Integration with alternative transcription services
- [ ] Cross-linking between notes based on content context using AI relevance agent
  - Dedicated AI agent evaluates existing vault notes for contextual relevance
  - Creates bidirectional links with related content
  - Builds semantic connections across your knowledge base

## üîç Technical Features

### Local Processing
Audio extraction and file management happen locally, minimizing bandwidth usage.

### Robust Error Handling
The tool automatically recovers from interruptions and API failures.

### Efficient Resource Usage
Optimized to minimize CPU and memory usage while running in the background.

### Structured Logging
